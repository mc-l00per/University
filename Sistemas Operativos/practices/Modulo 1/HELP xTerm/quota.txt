NAME
       quota - display disk usage and limits

SYNOPSIS
       quota [ -F format-name ] [ -guqvswi ] [ -l | [ -QAm ]]
       quota [ -F format-name ] [ -qvswi ] [ -l | [ -QAm ]] -u user...
       quota [ -F format-name ] [ -qvswi ] [ -l | [ -QAm ]] -g group...
       quota [ -F format-name ] [ -qvswugQm ] -f filesystem...

DESCRIPTION
       quota  displays users' disk usage and limits.  By default only the user
       quotas are printed.

       quota reports the quotas of all the filesystems  listed  in  /etc/mtab.
       For  filesystems  that are NFS-mounted a call to the rpc.rquotad on the
       server machine is performed to get the information.

OPTIONS
       -F, --format=format-name
              Show quota  for  specified  format  (ie.  don't  perform  format
              autodetection).   Possible  format  names are: vfsold (version 1
              quota), vfsv0 (version 2  quota),  rpc  (quota  over  NFS),  xfs
              (quota on XFS filesystem)

       -g, --group
              Print  group quotas for the group of which the user is a member.
              The optional group argument(s)  restricts  the  display  to  the
              specified group(s).

       -u, --user
              flag is equivalent to the default.

       -v, --verbose
              will  display  quotas  on  filesystems where no storage is allo‐
              cated.

       -s, --human-readable
              option will make quota(1) try to choose units for  showing  lim‐
              its, used space and used inodes.

       -p, --raw-grace
              When user is in grace period, report time in seconds since epoch
              when his grace time runs out (or has run out). Field is '0' when
              no  grace  time  is  in  effect.  This is especially useful when
              parsing output by a script.

       -i, --no-autofs
              ignore mountpoints mounted by automounter

       -l, --local-only
              report quotas only on local filesystems (ie. ignore NFS  mounted
              filesystems).

       -A, --all-nfs
              report  quotas for all NFS filesystems even if they report to be
              on the same device.

       -m, --no-mixed-pathnames
              Currently, pathnames of NFSv4 mountpoints are sent without lead‐
              ing slash in the path.  rpc.rquotad uses this to recognize NFSv4
              mounts and properly prepend pseudoroot of NFS filesystem to  the
              path.  If  you  specify  this  option, setquota will always send
              paths with a trailing slash. This can be useful for legacy  rea‐
              sons  but  be aware that quota over RPC will stop working if you
              are using new rpc.rquotad.

       -q, --quiet
              Print a more  terse  message,  containing  only  information  on
              filesystems where usage is over quota.

       -Q, --quiet-refuse
              Do  not  print  error  message  if  connection to rpc.rquotad is
              refused (usually this happens when rpc.rquotad is not running on
              the server).

       -w, --no-wrap
              Do not wrap the line if the device name is too long. This can be
              useful when parsing the output of quota(1) by a script.

       Specifying both -g and -u displays both the user quotas and  the  group
       quotas (for the user).

       Only  the super-user may use the -u flag and the optional user argument
       to view the limits of other users.  Non-super-users can use the the  -g
       flag  and  optional group argument to view only the limits of groups of
       which they are members.

       The -q flag takes precedence over the -v flag.

DIAGNOSTICS
       If quota exits with a non-zero status, one or more filesystems are over
       quota.

FILES
       aquota.user  or  aquota.group
                           quota file at the filesystem root (version 2 quota,
                           non-XFS filesystems)
       quota.user  or  quota.group
                           quota file at the filesystem root (version 1 quota,
                           non-XFS filesystems)
       /etc/mtab           default filesystems
